    <h2>A – Create Basic Website</h2> 
    <p>Each student will create a website with several web pages that use HTML5, CSS3 and
        images. Students are expected to implement fully functional navigation between the pages.
        You will need to create a website to show case your abilities – an online portfolio of your
        work. The website should consist of several pages with properly implemented navigation
        between them. At a minimum, your website should consist of at least three web pages. You
        are encouraged to have more pages if doing so provides a better user experience.
        When designing and implementing the website, you need to keep the following</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                requirements in mind:
                • Showcase your existing work and, if appropriate, provide narrative for it. Highlight
                your talents and abilities.
            </li>
            <li>Project a professional image. Your audience is prospective employers, clients or
                recruitment agents.</li>
                <li>Provide a method for interested parties to contact you.
                    Your website should work well on a desktop computer with Firefox and Chrome.</li>
        </ul>
